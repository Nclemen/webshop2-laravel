notes when trying to create a route:

most tutorials for laravel show the old way of adding a controller to a route and since i'm using laravel 8 it doesn't work like that anymore.

    the new syntax of adding a controller to a route is:

    Route::get('/', [HomeController::class, 'index'])

    the new syntax of adding a controller to a route is: 
    
    Route::get('/', 'HomeController@index');

    to use the old syntax i had to uncomment line 29 in the RouteServiceProvider
